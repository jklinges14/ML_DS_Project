# ML_DS_Project

Machine Learning & Data Science Project:   

A Machine Learning model that can predict the number  of admissions as well as number of placements in Engineering Colleges depending upon their current facilities and previous records. Using this an organisation would be able to know its current situation and the fields in which improvements can be done. Also using this model a student can check whether there is chance of getting admission in a preferred college according to his academic record and skillset.
